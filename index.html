                    Dearest Carolyn, <br><br>

                    The first step towards anything is probably the most important step. 
                    It sets the momentum towards the path to victory and succeed. 
                    Being chatting with you for the last one month, allows me to think about success 
                    and victory in a different way. In a "us" way instead of in a "me" way. 
                    But victory is not without misstep. While we have the privilege to have our first 
                    step well and good, I afraid the future steps may not be as beautiful and there may 
                    be times that we have to go our dark steps together. Many of them. Like Job did. 
                    But I promise that I will stand firm with you. I will always go back to the first step
                    and look at why we begin and how we begin. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Carolyn Khoo, will you take this first step with me? 

                    It seems we both have been waiting for this time to come. 
                    God has been gracious and patient to mold the both of us 
                    to be His Son and Daughter in Christ these few years. For Bryan, 
                    he has been diligently reading his bible for the last seven years while 
                    seemingly thinking that he will be single until the day, God provides!
                    You are beautiful inside out. Your soul and spirit  
                    
                    <br><br>
                    How should the relationship progress: <br>
                    We should always choose love from the bible and not love from the world. 
                    We should always choose to move on instead of remain static.
                    We should always choose to forgive
                    We should never test God
                    We should always keep the good parts of suprise and remvoe the antixous part of surprise
                    We should hold tightly on God and not on the good times or the bad times.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Basically, you completed my statement many times. 
                    You just "fit" me. Your personality is suitable for me. Genesis 2:18
                    It's like in genesis. But more than that, even one day, you no longer fit or become suitable. I will remember that you are the one who forgive me (if i forget, slap me). 
                    The one who showed me mercy, to give me new hope for a relationship, the one who encourage me.
