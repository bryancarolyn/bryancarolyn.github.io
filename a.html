    Dearest Carolyn, <br><br>

    <p>
        The first step is likely the most important step of a journey. 
        Whoever takes the first step defines the momentum. 
        And the momentum of the journey towards the path of success.
    </p>

    <p>
        This momentum is powered entirely on the grace of God to keep going on. It requires us to experience God as a Father. 
        To seek and see Him face to face, like a child climbing up to His shoulder. 
        100% intimate and close. Witnessing His every breath and sensing His every heart beat. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes, the journey can get dark. The closer we stand with God, the darker it may become.
        Because He protects us with His wings as the trouble of this world hits. It became dark because 
        He hid us under His wings. (Psalm 91.) And we have to faithfully wait for Him to signal to us at the right time, to go out again.
    </p>

    <p>You are a gift of God because you represent His goodness to me. 
    </p>

    <p>Every rush of adrenaline. Every moment with Carolyn. Every blessing and assurance from God are guaranteed all the time. 
    We get invited to receive His inheritance and enter the Kingdom.
    We get to rejoice at a wonderful pace where work will be filled with joy! There will be 
    no more pain and tears. There will be forever peace and true rest in His kingdom.  
    All of these is only possible because our Father reigns at His throne. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The faithfulness of God cannot be judged based on one incident or one event. 
        We have to look at life at its entirety to see the full goodness and faithfulness of God. 
        While you are facing some uncertainty and doubt, I hope that God will use me mightily to dispel all of them until our 
        last day where we step into His kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
        And it is my opinion that our Father in Heaven, took that very first step of this journey, for us, to prepare us. 
        To prepare 'we' for greater things ahead. 
        
        Are you willing to continue this Journey with me? :) 
    </p>

        Carolyn Khoo, will you be my girlfriend? Will You?
