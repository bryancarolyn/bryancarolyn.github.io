                    Dearest Carolyn, <br><br>

                    <p>
                        The first step is likely the most important step of a journey. 
                        It sets the momentum of the journey towards the path of victory and success.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This momentum relies entirely on the grace of God to keep going on. It requires us to experience God as a Father. 
                        To seek and see Him face to face, like a child climbing up to His shoulder. 
                        100% intimate and close. Witnessing His every breath and sensing His every heart beat. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes, the journey can get dark. The closer we stand with God, the darker it may become.
                        Because He protects us with His wings as the trouble of this world hits. It became dark because 
                        He hid us under His wings. (Psalm 91.) And we need to wait for Him to signal to us at the right time, to go out again.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we need a total surrender to Jesus until we receive
                        an answer again. Sometimes we need to repent multiple times. 
                        Until something not of God, dies again. It requires us to trust 
                        God as a friend. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Sometimes, the world may feed us with lies.  we may think that we are not enough. Sometimes, we have no strength to sing
                    and praise. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Sometimes, we may experience injustice that makes our life meaningless and dreadful. 
                        we may lament constantly and may even insinuate that God is unfair. 
                    </p>

                    <p>And sometimes, with God's help, we can overcome the trouble of this life 
                    simply because of the goodness of Our Father. 
                    </p>

                <p>And all the time, we get the assurance and blessings of God. We get invited to receive His inheritance and enter the Kingdom.
                We get to rejoice at a wonderful pace where work will be filled with joy! There will be 
                no more pain and tears. There will be forever peace and true rest in His kingdom.  
                All of these is only possible because our Father reigns at His throne. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    And it is my opinion that our Father in Heaven, took that very first step of this journey, for us, to prepare us. 
                    To prepare 'we' for greater things ahead. 
                    
                    Are you willing to continue this journey with me? :) 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carolyn Khoo, will you be my girlafriend? Will You?
