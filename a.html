                    Dearest Carolyn, <br><br>

                    <p>
                        The first step is likely the most important step of a journey. 
                        It sets the momentum of the journey towards the path of victory and success.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This momentum relies entirely on the grace of God to keep going on. It requires us to experience God as a Father. 
                        To seek and see Him face to face, like a child climbing up to His shoulder. 
                        100% intimate and close. Witnessing His every breath and sensing His every heart beat. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes, the journey can get dark. The closer we stand with God, the darker it may become.
                        Because He protects us with His wings as the trouble of this world hits. It became dark because 
                        He hid us under His wings. (Psalm 91.) And we have to faithfully wait for Him to signal to us at the right time, to go out again.
                    </p>

                    <p>Every rush of adrenaline. Every moment with Carolyn. Every blessing and assurance from God are guaranteed all the time. 
                    We get invited to receive His inheritance and enter the Kingdom.
                    We get to rejoice at a wonderful pace where work will be filled with joy! There will be 
                    no more pain and tears. There will be forever peace and true rest in His kingdom.  
                    All of these is only possible because our Father reigns at His throne. 
                    </p>

                <p>
                    And it is my opinion that our Father in Heaven, took that very first step of this journey, for us, to prepare us. 
                    To prepare 'we' for greater things ahead. 
                    
                    Are you willing to continue this journey with me? :) 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carolyn Khoo, will you be my girlafriend? Will You?
